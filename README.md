## Description

**A Noroff project repo**: This repo is for the Project Exam 1 in Noroff FED.

The project was allocated five weeks from beginning to end and involved coding the site from scratch as well as setting up WordPress as a headless CMS and populating it with the posts for the blog. 

There were specific tasks that had to be done and integrated into the site, such as building a slider, the use of a "load more" button and validating the contact form. The site also had to include Hotjar analytics. In addition there were options to add filtering and search to the blogs, as well as commenting on the posts.

### **The brief in short**:
